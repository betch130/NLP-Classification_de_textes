    "# Tâche 3 - Classification automatique de descriptions d'incidents\n",
    "\n",
    "Cette tâche vise à classifier de courts textes décrivant des incidents qui se sont produits sur des chantiers de construction. Pour chaque incident, on retrouve une étiquette qui correspond au type d’incident (0 à 8). \n",
    "\n",
    "Les objectifs de cette tâche sont: \n",
    "- de se familiariser avec la classification de texte\n",
    "- d'apprendre à utiliser les fonctions de base de scikit-learn\n",
    "- de comprendre comment représenter un texte sous la forme d'un sac de mots (*bag of words*)\n",
    "- de faire l'évaluation d'un modèle de classification avec un corpus de test\n",
    "- de tenter d'interpréter les résultats d'un modèle à l'aide des poids d'attributs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pour la première partie, vous devez construire une fonction (*train_and_test_classifier*) qui entraîne un modèle (les options étant la régression logistique et le naïf bayésien) et en faire l'évaluation sur des données d'entraînement et des données de test. Vous devez également évaluer l'impact de la lemmatisation de mots sur la performance des classificateurs. Deux fichiers de textes sont disponibles pour mener votre expérimentation (voir Section 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pour la deuxième partie, tentez de déterminer à quoi correspond chacune des classes d’incident. Faites une analyse des poids des modèles pour proposer des étiquettes pour chacune des classes. Vous pouvez vous inspirer des notebooks disponibles sur le site du cours. Expliquez clairement comment vous êtes arrivé à vos conclusions. L’important ici est de dégager le thème principal à partir de vos observations et non pas de trouver la formulation exacte des étiquettes. Veuillez noter que certaines classes sont (très) difficiles à identifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Merci de respecter les signatures des fonctions *train_and_test_classifier* et *load_incident_dataset*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note sur la lemmatisation: Cette normalisation de texte nécessite l'utilisation d'un modèle qui repose sur l'apprentissage automatique. En conséquence, son temps d'exécution est plus long que le stemming. Si jamais cela ralentit trop vos expérimentations, il est possible de ne faire le traitement qu'une seule fois en sauvegardant les résultats après la première lemmatisation d'un fichier. Cela n'est toutefois pas exigé pour la remise de votre travail et ne sera pas évalué. "

Employee #1  had been with the company about 18 years and was considered by his foreman to  be an experienced heavy equipment operator. At the time of the accident  the  employer was in the process of raising the berm by 6 inches by using the  articulating truck to dump material  which was then bulldozed to level it  and  then a mobile compactor was used to compact it in place. The employer had four  employees on site; three operating the different pieces of equipment and a  foreman. The weather was sunny and clear. The work was being conducted at the  Miami- Dade Water and Sewer Department construction of a new waste water  treatment plant in Homestead  Florida. The 49 075 pound Caterpillar Model 725  articulating truck was travelling on a western direction at the north end of  the retention pond when the edge of the berm gave way and fell into the water.

He proceeded to the lake but was unable to find the  Model Number D9H bulldozer or Employee #1. Employee #1 had driven the  Caterpillar bulldozer into the lake  while moving fill material  and he  drowned. The Investigation revealed that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was in  reverse  and the throttle position was at full  as confirmed by underwater  photographs. The transmission had three forward and three reverse gears. For  unknown reasons  Employee #1 had pushed a large amount of fill into the lake   in the center of the fill area  instead of moving in a consistent left to  right pattern. The reason for the left to right pattern was to slowly extend  the line of fill into the lake consistently  so that it could support the  weight of the equipment. It appears that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was on  this central peninsula  which failed under the weight  and caused the  bulldozer and Employee #1 to enter the lake.                                    \n",

Employee #1's chest was caught between the lift's guardrail system and  a beam. He was killed. The aerial lift had several modifications. The \"Lift  Enable\" and \"Up/Down\" selector switches were unable to spring back to the  Neutral/Stop position when either switch was released. The broken \"Lift  Enable\" switch was not the original manufacturer's equipment. The  \"Lift/Off/Drive\" select key switch had been changed to a switch that did not  require a key. The aerial platform did not have a tilt alarm (a device that  would sense when the machine is out of level in any direction)  disable the  drive and lift functions of the aerial platform  and actuate audible and  visible alarms. The forward and reverse joystick did not function properly.  The spring-loaded collar that was designed to hold the joystick in the neutral  position was inoperable  allowing the platform/lift to move with the slightest  tap or bump. The operator's control box (Serial Number 602423) on the aerial  platform was not the original manufacturer's equipment.                         \n",
